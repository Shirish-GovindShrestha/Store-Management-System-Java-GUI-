# Store-Management-System-Java-GUI-
This project is a continuation of a previous coursework that managed Store objects (Departments and Retailers) through a text-based interface. In this version, a graphical user interface (GUI) is designed using Java Swing and AWT, making the system more user-friendly and interactive.
